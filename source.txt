	*gameinfo

	-"This game is based on Cookie Clicker and other incremental/idle games. Begin by creating the guild and clicking the Oryx picture to generate fame. This will unlock buildings and upgrades that generate fame automatically. The more buildings and fame you have, the more upgrades you can buy - there are currently 623 upgrades and 165 achievements to unlock. Aside from leveling up guildmates to provide fame, you can spend fame to destroy monsters, starting from beach monsters and going up all the way to Oryx in a 70-enemy chain. Killing monsters provides a special currency called souls (lowlands = 1 soul per monster, midlands = 2 souls per monster, highlands = 3, etc.) which are required to buy certain upgrades in the game. The entire chain up to Oryx 2 only yields 331 souls, so you'll have to reset multiple times (resetting is unlocked after destroying all the event bosses) in order to buy all the soul-based upgrades. The third and final currency is realm gold, which can be increased via a special building."
